# Wireframing

## What is Wireframing?

Wireframing is a way of drawing or creating a basic layout of a website or app. It shows where things like buttons, images, text, and menus will go. A wireframe is like a blueprint before the real design and coding start.

## Why is Wireframing Important?

Wireframing is important because:

- It helps us plan the structure of the website or app.
- It makes it easier to talk with teammates, clients, or users about the design.
- It saves time because we can fix problems early before starting the real work.
- It helps us focus on the layout and user experience (UX) without thinking about colors or images yet.

## When to Use Wireframing?

You use wireframing in the early stages of a project, before you design or build the final product. It helps you think clearly and organize your ideas.
