# Wireframing

## What is Wireframing?

Wireframing is a way of drawing or creating a basic layout of a website or app. It shows where things like buttons, images, text, and menus will go. A wireframe is like a blueprint before the real design and coding start.

## Why is Wireframing Important?

Wireframing is important because:

- It helps us plan the structure of the website or app.
- It makes it easier to talk with teammates, clients, or users about the design.
- It saves time because we can fix problems early before starting the real work.
- It helps us focus on the layout and user experience (UX) without thinking about colors or images yet.

## When to Use Wireframing?

You use wireframing in the early stages of a project, before you design or build the final product. It helps you think clearly and organize your ideas.

## Key Elements of a Wireframe

Here are the main parts that you will usually see in a wireframe:

### 1. Layout Structure

This is the basic framework of the page. It shows how the screen is divided into sections — for example, a header at the top, a sidebar on the side, and a footer at the bottom.

**Example:**  
A homepage may have a layout with a top menu bar, a big image banner, some product sections in the middle, and a footer with contact links. This layout helps users quickly understand where they are.

### 2. Navigation

Navigation shows how users will move around the website or app. It includes menus, tabs, and buttons that guide the user from one page to another.

**Example:**  
A wireframe of a shopping app may show a top menu with buttons like “Home”, “Shop”, “Cart”, and “Profile”. This helps users know how to get to the page they want.

### 3. Content Placement

This is where text, images, videos, and other content will go. It helps designers and writers know where their work will appear.

**Example:**  
A blog wireframe may show where the blog title, author name, and article text will go. This makes sure everything is placed clearly and neatly.

### 4. Functionality

Functionality shows how things work on the page, like buttons, forms, or pop-ups. It explains what happens when a user clicks or types something.

**Example:**  
A login form wireframe might show two input fields (for email and password) and a "Login" button. It may also show what happens if the user enters the wrong password.
