# Wireframing

## What is Wireframing?

Wireframing is a way of drawing or creating a basic layout of a website or app. It shows where things like buttons, images, text, and menus will go. A wireframe is like a blueprint before the real design and coding start.

## Why is Wireframing Important?

Wireframing is important because:

- It helps us plan the structure of the website or app.
- It makes it easier to talk with teammates, clients, or users about the design.
- It saves time because we can fix problems early before starting the real work.
- It helps us focus on the layout and user experience (UX) without thinking about colors or images yet.

## When to Use Wireframing?

You use wireframing in the early stages of a project, before you design or build the final product. It helps you think clearly and organize your ideas.

## Key Elements of a Wireframe

Here are the main parts that you will usually see in a wireframe:

### 1. Layout Structure

This is the basic framework of the page. It shows how the screen is divided into sections — for example, a header at the top, a sidebar on the side, and a footer at the bottom.

**Example:**  
A homepage may have a layout with a top menu bar, a big image banner, some product sections in the middle, and a footer with contact links. This layout helps users quickly understand where they are.

### 2. Navigation

Navigation shows how users will move around the website or app. It includes menus, tabs, and buttons that guide the user from one page to another.

**Example:**  
A wireframe of a shopping app may show a top menu with buttons like “Home”, “Shop”, “Cart”, and “Profile”. This helps users know how to get to the page they want.

### 3. Content Placement

This is where text, images, videos, and other content will go. It helps designers and writers know where their work will appear.

**Example:**  
A blog wireframe may show where the blog title, author name, and article text will go. This makes sure everything is placed clearly and neatly.

### 4. Functionality

Functionality shows how things work on the page, like buttons, forms, or pop-ups. It explains what happens when a user clicks or types something.

**Example:**  
A login form wireframe might show two input fields (for email and password) and a "Login" button. It may also show what happens if the user enters the wrong password.

## Types of Wireframes

There are mainly two types of wireframes: **low-fidelity** and **high-fidelity**.

### Low-Fidelity Wireframes

- These are quick and simple sketches or digital drafts.
- They are usually black and white and don’t show much detail.
- They are used early in the design process to share ideas and test layouts.

**Example:**  
A hand-drawn layout of a homepage showing only boxes and labels like "Image", "Menu", or "Text".

### High-Fidelity Wireframes

- These wireframes are more detailed and look closer to the final product.
- They may include colors, real content, icons, and exact spacing.
- They are used later in the process when the structure is clear, and the team needs to prepare for design or development.

**Example:**  
A full wireframe of a mobile app showing real buttons, images, and how the app will work and look.

## What Type of Wireframe Is This?

It is a **high-fidelity wireframe**.

it is more detailed and includes real design elements like:

- Fonts and colors
- Buttons and icons
- Proper spacing and alignment
- Real text or sample content
- Images

High-fidelity wireframes are often shared with clients or developers to show how the final product will function and look.
